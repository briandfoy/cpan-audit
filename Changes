Revision history for Perl extension CPAN-Audit

20241208.001 2024-12-08T21:10:30Z
	* The database of advisories now exists as a separate distribution so
	it can update itself frequently without requiring new releases of this
	distribution. The code will look for CPANSA::DB or CPAN::Audit::DB, and
	the CPAN::Audit::DB now comes with CPANSA:DB. CPAN::Audit::DB will
	eventually be phased out.
	* The `installed` command now looks only at the versions you have 
	installed. This changes the comparison from '>=' to '=='. (#62)
	* The default range operator is now `==` instead of `>=`. You can 
	always specify which way you want the check to work by using an
	explicit range operator
	* Since these are significant changes, please report any weird
	situations that might arise.

20241121.001_001 2024-11-21T22:45:15Z
